    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
       This Swedish meatball recipe is our family's Christmas tradition.
       <br>We frequently double the recipe and keep it warm in a slow cooker.
       <br>Worth the effort, and the meatballs are even better the next day!
       <br>Reserve brown gravy and add sour cream to it the day you serve the
       leftovers.
    </p>    
    <strong><em>Ingredients:</em></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>2 slices day-old white bread, crumbled</li>
        <li>½ cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, minced</li>
        <li>⅔ pound ground beef</li>
        <li>⅓ pound finely ground pork</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground ginger (Optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or as needed</li>
        <li>2 cups beef broth, or as needed</li>
        <li>½ (8 ounce) container sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <strong><em>Steps:</em></strong>
    <ol>
        <li> Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
        <li> Place bread crumbs into a small bowl; mix in cream. 
            <br>Allow to stand until crumbs absorb cream, about 10 minutes. </li>
        <li> Meanwhile, melt 1 teaspoon butter in a skillet over medium heat;
            <br> cook and stir onion until light brown, about 10 minutes.
                Transfer onion to a mixing bowl. </li>
        <li> Mix ground beef, ground pork, egg, brown sugar, salt, black pepper,
            <br> nutmeg, allspice, and ginger with onion in
                the mixing bowl. Lightly mix in bread crumbs and cream. </li>
        <li> Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            <br>Pinch off about 1 1/2 tablespoon meat mixture per meatball;
                form into balls. Place meatballs into the skillet and cook, 
            <br>turning often, until browned, about 5 minutes. Insides of
            <br> meatballs will still be pink. </li>
        <li> Place browned meatballs into a baking dish, pour in chicken broth,
            <br> and cover with foil. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven until meatballs are tender, about 40 minutes.
            <br> Remove meatballs to a serving dish. </li>
        <li> Pour pan drippings into a saucepan over medium heat.
            <br> Whisk flour into drippings until smooth. </li>
        <li> Gradually whisk in enough beef broth to total about 2 1/2 cups liquid. </li>
        <li> Bring gravy to a simmer, whisking constantly, until thickened, about 5 minutes. </li>
        <li> Just before serving, whisk in sour cream. Season with salt and black pepper.
            <br> Serve gravy with meatballs. </li>            
    </ol>
